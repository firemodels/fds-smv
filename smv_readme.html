(Issue 637).

<li> fix: fix how slices are grouped together into multi-slices when some of the slices are 3D.
All 3D slices of the same type are grouped into one multi-slice, non 3D slices are grouped as before.

to document cases.

<li> enhancement - Add menu item and command key equivalent (%) for toggling the projection type.  Pressing '%' toggles between
perspective and size preserving projection methods for displaying the scene.

<li> enhancement: Add a dialog box for setting up and running smokeview scripts.
The dialog box includes several items such as specifying a custom configuration/.ini file name for later loading by the script, specifying custom render images file names,
specifying the render directory.  As a result, the edits required to finalize the auto-generated script are minimal.

<li> enhancement: Improve the layout and functionality of the motion dialog box.
(Issue 534).

<li> enhancement: Add window size option (1920x1080) to Motion dialog box

<li> fix: hrrpuvcutoff values now clamped down to 1199.99 since hrrpuv 3d file data can ONLY contain hrrpuv's between 0 and 1200.  A hrrpuvcutoff value greater
than 1200.0 would result in hiding of ALL hrrpuv data.
(Issue 524).

<li> fix: fix clipping when displaying cad textures (and devices) -
(Issue 536).

<li>fix - fixed the cad texture display and
texture file flipping issue by

<li>enhancement - add support for transparency and shininess to the CAD file format
<li>fix - save particle color state in .ini file so that the same view is presented if particles are reloaded.
(Issue 489).
<li>fix - fix color display of CAD output when smoke is also displayed
(Issue 491).
</ol>

<p><li>5.2.5 (build 2466) - October 8, 2008
<ol>
<li>enhancement - add value labels to isosurface menus to make clear which surfaces are being displayed
(Issue 473).
<li>change - change terminology from "Show ignited" to "Show temperature threshold" in the boundary value File/Bounds dialog box
to make clear that hilighted regions are not necessarily
burning but have simply exceeded a specified temperature threshold value.

(Issue 412).
</ol>

<p><li>5.2 (build 2039) - July 17, 2008
<ol>
<li>enhancement - Add an option to speed up smoke visualization by using the
graphics programming unit (GPU) to perform some of the needed computations.
This option is not supported on Linux or Mac OSX releases of Smokeview.
The option is turned off
by default and may be toggled on and off by pressing the 'G' key.

<li>enhancement - add the ability to run Smokeview in a <em>batch</em> or unattended
mode.  This mode may be used to automatically load a data file, view it from
a prescribed direction and render the resulting image.  This may be repeated for other views
and/or other data files.  A script named <em>casename.ssf</em> may be executed by typing
<p><tt>smokeview -runscript casename </tt>
<p>at a command line or from the <tt>Load/Unload>Script Options</tt> menu.
Scripts are created by adding desired commands to a text file named casename.ssf
or by turning on the <em>script recorder</em> found in the
Load/Unload>Script Options menu.

<li>enhancment - internal change in smokeview resulting in reduced memory
requirements when loading large cases.

<li>enhancement - save smooth blockages to a file so that their definition may be read in rather than re-calculated.
<li>enhancement - add an option to simplify file compression by compressing only files that were selected for auto-loading.
<li>enhancement - save the size preserving or perspective projection state in the .ini file
(Issue 331).
<li>enhancement - implement the "AUTOTERRAIN" keyword for WUI applications of FDS.  If all blockages are used to implement terrain
(ie no blockages are used to represent buildings on the terrain), then AUTOTERRAIN is used to signal Smokeview to draw a smooth
surface representing the terrain.
<li>enhancement -  add option to toggle slice file offset -
(Issue 348).
<li>enhancement - add support for skipping particle frames created by FDS 5 or later.
(Issue 350).
<li>fix - For particle files created by FDS 5, remove the particle skip option as it is no longer supported. (Issue 350).
<li>fix - change a conversion factor from 256*128 to 256*128-1 to avoid a "short int" overflow.   Otherwise, some
particles may be drawn outside the solution domain.
(Issue 323).
<li>fix - fix the 't' toggle when the grid is turned on.
(Issue 334).
<li>fix - force smooth blockages to be drawn opaquely to prevent drawing artifact errors when drawn with smoke.
(Issue 329).
<li>fix - Fix drawing when smoke, iso and slice routines have non-increasing time steps.
This could occur when FDS is restarted to an earlier time than was saved in these data files.
(Issue 317).

(Issue 325).
</ol>

<p><li>5.1.3 (build 1501) - March 26, 2008

<ol>
<li>enhancement - add demo mode, activated by copying casename.smv to casename.svd .

and viewpoints (defined in an .ini file).  Further details are found in the Smokeview user's guide.
<li>enhancement - add avatars to FDS-EVAC visualizations and Smokeview tours.  Avatars are defined in the device.svo file.
